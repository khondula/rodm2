Organize site, sample, and sensor data all in one place!

The goal of **rodm2** is to make it easy to use the [ODM2](https://github.com/ODM2/ODM2) data model in R, in order to promote collaboration between ecologists, hydrologists, and soil scientists. It is intended to help manage complex field data using a sophisticated relational data model without requiring prior knowledge of advanced database principles. 

> How does it work? 

Package functions create parameterized SQL statements to populate and query a flat file (sqlite) database using inputs such as site names, variables, and date ranges. Interactive features (shiny gadgets) are included to facilitate the use of a controlled vocabulary and represent complex hierarchical site and sampling designs within the database structure. 

## Getting started 

You can install this package from GitHub with:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("khondula/rodm2")
```

* Set up or connect to an ODM2 database file on your computer with `create_sqlite()` or `connect_sqlite()`
* Insert metadata about sites, methods, measured variables using `db_describe_%METADATA TYPE%()` functions
* Optionally, label sites with annotations and describe hierarchical site designs as related features using `db_annotate()` and `db_add_relations()`
* Insert data from time series, in situ point or profile measurements, or ex situ data from samples collected in the field using `db_insert_results_%RESULT TYPE%()`
* Query results based on site, variable, and data type (e.g. time series, samples) using `db_get_results()`

## Workflow 

The basic steps of using rodm2 are: 

### 1. Connect 

Load rodm2 and create a connection to your database. If you don't have an existing database, create an empty ODM2 sqlite database and connection using `create_sqlite(connect = TRUE)` or if you are starting from an existing database use `connect_sqlite()`. You can view and edit this database using [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) outside of R. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(rodm2)
db <- rodm2::create_sqlite(connect = TRUE)
```

### 2. Describe metadata

Add information about sites, methods, measured variables, etc. using `db_describe_%TABLE%` functions. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}

db_describe_site(db, 
                 site_code = "501R1", 
                 sitetypecv = "Site")

db_describe_method(db,
                   methodname = "Sonic anemometer", 
                   methodcode = "SA", 
                   methodtypecv = "dataRetrieval")
```

Optionally, use annotations and relationships with `db_annotate()` and `db_add_relations()` to label site groups and represent sampling designs. 

### 3. Insert data 

Data are uploaded using "insert" functions for specific types of results such as time series, samples, measurements, or a vertical profile. For time series data, the data to upload should have data values for one or more variables collected at one site using the same instrument. It needs at least 2 timepoints, and a "Timestamp column" formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. For example:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ts_data <- tibble::tibble(Timestamp = c("2018-06-27 13:45:00", "2018-06-27 13:55:00"),
                   "wd" = c(180,170),
                   "ws" = c(1, 1.5), 
                   "gustspeed" = c(2, 2.5))
knitr::kable(ts_data)
```

The type of data in each column needs to be described in a "variables list" with terms and units from a controlled vocabulary. Create this list for a dataset using a shiny gadget (opens in the Viewer pane of RStudio) with the function `make_vars_list()`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vars_list <- make_vars_list(ts_data)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
vars_list <- list(
  'wd' = list(
    column = 'wd', 
    name = 'Wind direction', 
    units = 'Degree'),
  'ws' = list(
    column = 'ws', 
    name = 'Wind speed', 
    units = 'Meter per Second'),
  'gustspeed' = list(
    column = 'gustspeed', 
    name = 'Wind gust speed', 
    units = 'Meter per Second')
)

```

![vars list shiny gadget](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khondula/rodm2/master/man/figures/vars-gadget.png)

Once the `vars_list` is created, use it in the `db_insert_results_ts()` function to upload data along with its associated metadata

```{r}
db_insert_results_ts(db, 
                     datavalues = ts_data,
                     methodcode = "SA",
                     site_code = "501R1",
                     variables = vars_list,
                     sampledmedium = "air")
```

Data associated with samples taken in the field and a property measured in the lab needs to have at least 4 columns corresponding to Timestamp, Site ID, Sample ID, and data value. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sample_data <- tibble::tibble(Timestamp = c("2018-06-27 13:45:00", "2018-07-27 13:55:00"),
                              Site = c("501R1", "501R1"),
                              Sample = c("DOC001", "DOC002"),
                              DOC = c(10, 12.3))
knitr::kable(sample_data)
```

Sample data are inserted with `db_insert_results_samples()` which requires metadata about both the method used to collect samples as well as the method used to analyze the sample. Provide details using `db_describe_%METADATA%()` functions.

```{r}
db_describe_method(db, methodname = "Shimadzu", 
                   methodtypecv = "specimenAnalysis",
                   methodcode = "Shimadzu")
db_describe_method(db, methodname = "Water sample", 
                   methodtypecv = "specimenCollection",
                   methodcode = "watersamp")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vars_list <- make_vars_list(sample_data[,4])
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
vars_list <- list(
  'DOC' = list(
    column = 'DOC', 
    name = 'Carbon, dissolved organic', 
    units = 'Milligram per Liter')
)
```

```{r}
db_insert_results_samples(db, 
                          sample_data, 
                          field_method = "watersamp",
                          lab_method = "Shimadzu", 
                          variables = vars_list, 
                          sampledmedium = "liquidAqueous")
```

The insert function assumes that Site IDs are in a column called "Site" and Sample IDs are in a column called "Sample" but you can specify otherwise with the arguments `site_code_col` and `sample_code_col`. See more options for specifying metadata in the documentation for `db_insert_results_samples()`

### 4. Query

`db_get_results()` returns a list of dataframes with each type of result requested. By default retrieves data associated with all site codes and variables. 

```{r}
results_data <- db_get_results(db, result_type = c("ts", "sample"))
str(results_data)
```

Use list subsetting to get a data frame with time series (ts) results.

```{r}
ts_data <- results_data[["Time_series_data"]]
# OR
ts_data <- results_data$Time_series_data

head(ts_data)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
RSQLite::dbDisconnect(db)
```

## More details 

`rodm2` is being designed to work either with an existing ODM2 database on a server (e.g. PostgreSQL), or with spreadsheet files that aren't (yet!) in a relational database. This package is intended to help populate, query, and visualize data that is organized with the ODM2 structure. It should not be necessary to understand ODM2 or SQL but it may help! See [here](http://odm2.github.io/ODM2/schemas/ODM2_Current/diagrams/ODM2OverviewSimplified.html) for an overview of the data structure.
