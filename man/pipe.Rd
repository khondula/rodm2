\description{
Add relationships to related features table
}
\details{
Edgelist should be a data frame with 3 columns and one row for each new
relationship to establish with the features to connect and the type of relationship.
Specify the names of columns corresponding to the features using the 'from_column' and
'to_column' arguments, and the name of the column with relationship types with
'relationtype_column'. A two column data frame can be supplied along with a relationtype
to use for all of the new relationships. Site codes must already be in database.
}
\examples{
# df <- data.frame(
# "SamplingFeatureCode" = "subsite1",
# "RelatedFeatureCode" = "site1")
# db_add_relation(db, edgelist = df)
